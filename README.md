A fully responsive back-end focused marketplace CRUD application built with the MERN stack (React, MongoDB, Express & Node).

## About The Build

Building this full-stack marketplace application was a great opportunity to further develop some of the core concepts I had been learning up until now including the MERN stack with Redux, advanced CRUD functionality with search, but also:  <br />

- The core concepts of a marketplace application, how to collect money and pay out to sellers <br />
- Integrating Stripe payments to build a marketplace app <br />
- Advanced use case of Stripe to automate entire payment workflow to build a multi-user app <br />
- Building a server / API with filtering functionality <br />
<br />
